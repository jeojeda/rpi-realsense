https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/

Option 2:
1. Download and install Win32 Disk Imager from this link:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download
2. Plug the SD card into a SD card slot or adaptor for your PC.
3. Select the IMG file
4. Run Win32DiskImager.exe application (may just be shown as Win32DiskImager depending on your windows settings)
  Ensure the correct driver letter is selected for the SD card â€“ double check this is right in Windows Explorer as Win32DiskImager will overwrite the entire drive without warning if the wrong drive is selected!
  Select the <YOUR FILE NAME>.img file

6. Once the writing is done plug the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it up.
